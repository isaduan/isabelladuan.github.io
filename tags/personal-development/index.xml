      <description>Hey there! üëã I am Isabella, reading computational social science at the University of Chicago, currently on a gap year doing AI ethics &amp;amp; policy work at DeepMind.
I fall in love with complex questions in the intersection of AI and society. I am cautiously optimistic that AI will make the future awesome, but we must take the innitiative to make it happen. I would like to think like an ‚Äúinstitution designer,‚Äù constantly probing how we can create processes, norms, and organizations to make AI systems aligned with and accountable to people.</description>
