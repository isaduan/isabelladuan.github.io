Hey there! :wave: I am Isabella, reading computational social science at the University of Chicago, currently on a gap year doing AI ethics & policy work at DeepMind.

I fall in love with complex questions in the intersection of **AI and society**. I am cautiously optimistic that AI will make the future awesome, but we must take the innitiative to make it happen. I would like to think like an **“institution designer,”** constantly probing **_how we can create processes, norms, and organizations to make AI systems aligned with and accountable to people_.** The “we” can be at many levels: an individual like you and me, a corporate lab, the whole research community, or the industry ecosystem that is integrated with many verticals and with other industries - not to mention all the political units within, between, and above nation-states.

All views here are my own.
